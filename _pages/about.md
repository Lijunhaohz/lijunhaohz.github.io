About Me
======
I am a first-year graduate student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, enrolled in the **Master of Science in Computer Science(MSCS)** program. I have graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI), majoring in **Electrical and Computer Engineering**. I am interested in data mining systems, software development, and product design. I am currently working on my capstone design on generated AI QA assistant for campus information retreival under the guidance of Dr. [Jigang Wu](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/faculty-detail/139). I am also a research assistant at the [Interlligent Internet of Things Research Center, SJTU](https://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/#/), working on an integration framwork for irregular and incomplete time series analysis.

My research and professional interest is promoting the deployment of AI and data mining technologies with scalable and reliable systems. By integrating user-friendly interfaces and efficient algorithms, I aim to provide a better user experience and more accurate results for the end-users.
